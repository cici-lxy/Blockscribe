# Blockscribe – The Preemptive Blockchain Narrator

Blockscribe is an AI-driven middleware that **predicts and explains blockchain transactions in natural language before users sign them**. By analyzing the signature hash and calldata generated by a connected wallet, Blockscribe decodes the underlying smart contract interaction and provides a concise, human-readable summary of what the transaction will do—allowing users to make informed decisions before committing on-chain.

## 🔍 What It Does

**Pre-Transaction Analysis**: When a user initiates a transaction, Blockscribe intercepts the payload and sends it through a decoding pipeline powered by Ethers.js and a GPT-based interpretation layer. The system maps the function signature to known contract templates and produces natural-language explanations like:

> "You are about to grant permission for 2.5 ETH to be swapped for approximately 4,000 USDC on Uniswap."

The explanation is displayed through a clean, embeddable React widget that integrates seamlessly into dApps and wallets, **before the user signs the transaction**.

## 🛡️ Problem & Solution

**Problem**: Most users authorize blockchain transactions without fully understanding what they are signing. Hashes and calldata are opaque, making it easy for malicious or misleading contracts to exploit users.

**Solution**: Blockscribe bridges the gap between cryptographic data and user comprehension by providing real-time, pre-transaction analysis and risk assessment.
