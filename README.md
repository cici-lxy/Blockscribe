# BlockscribeBlockscribe – The Blockchain Narrator
Blockscribe is a developer-friendly middleware and UI toolkit that transforms raw blockchain transactions into clear, contextual, and human-readable narratives. Designed to bridge the gap between cryptographic complexity and user comprehension, Blockscribe empowers users to understand exactly what’s happening on-chain—without needing to decode hashes, logs, or calldata.
🔍 What It Does
Every time a transaction occurs—whether it’s minting an NFT, swapping tokens, voting in a DAO, or staking assets—Blockscribe intercepts the event, decodes the smart contract interaction, and translates it into a natural-language explanation like:
“You swapped 1.2 ETH for 2,300 USDC on Uniswap with a 0.3% fee.”
These explanations are displayed in a clean, embeddable frontend widget or returned via API, making it easy for dApps to integrate transparent, user-friendly transaction summaries.
🛠️ Core Features
* Smart Contract Mapping Engine: Associates contract functions with readable templates
* Event Decoder: Parses calldata and logs using Ethers.js
* Narration Layer: Generates contextual summaries using templates or AI (e.g., OpenAI)
* Frontend Widget: React-based component for displaying transaction stories
* Multilingual Support: Optional i18n layer for global accessibility
* AI Summary Mode: Personalized, natural-language explanations powered by LLMs
Local or On-Chain Support: Works with Hardhat testnets or live Ethereum networks

🎯 Use Cases
* DeFi: Explain swaps, staking, and yield farming in plain English
* NFTs: Narrate minting, listing, and transfers
* DAOs: Summarize governance proposals and votes
* Onboarding: Help new users understand what just happened in their wallet
